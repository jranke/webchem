`webchem` is a R package to retrieve chemical information from  the web. 
This package interacts with a suite of web APIs to retrieve chemical information.

The functions in the package that hit a specific API have a prefix and suffix separated by an underscore (`prefix_suffix()`).
They follow the format of `source_functionality`, with the exception of functions that retrieve database identifiers which follow the format of `get_identifier`. e.g.`cs_compinfo` uses ChemSpider to retrieve compound informations and `get_csid()` retrieves ChemSpider IDs.

## Chemical databases currently accessed by webchem

At least some of the data in the following sources is accesible through `webchem` functions.  To learn more about what is available, browse the documentation [here](https://docs.ropensci.org/webchem/reference/index.html).
